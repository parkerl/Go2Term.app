Go2Term
-------------------------

After downloading the great free app [Go2Shell](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2shell/id445770608?mt=12) from the Mac app store I immediatly wanted the same function to open iTerm2. With a little bit of Applescript it wasn't too hard to replicate the functionality. Viola! Now you can Go2Term.


Installation
--------------------------

1. Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)

2. Clone this repo into /Applications

        git clone git@github.com:parkerl/Go2Term.app.git 
    
3. The best way to use it is to drag it onto the Finder toolbar.

When you click the Go2Term icon it will open an iTerm session cand `cd` into the topmost Finder window's current path.
